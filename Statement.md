## Problem Statement

In the era of technology where we people want to make our work easier or do in a short time we often 
tend to write  a long UPI ID just for the payment . We in daily life use online mode of payment
but it gets tiring to write the long UPI ID and if written wrong it stops the transaction.

So to solve this program I have designed this project just to help us. In this project 
I have made a Python based QR CODE GENERATOR in which you have to write UPI ID, name 
and the amount and your custom message and it generates a UPI Payment URL and generates a scannable QR CODE. 

## Scope Of The Project

- Generates the QR Codes according to the details mentioned by the user.

- Ensures the correct UPI ID is written and if something wrong asks the user to check again.

- Displays the generated QR code on a GUI.

- Saves the image of the generated QR Code.

## Target Users 

- Shopkeepers 

- Students who are learning Python 

- Programmers 

- Developers 

- Educators 

## High-Level Features : 

- Checks the UPI ID.

- Generates the UPI URL .

- Uses GUI QR GENERATOR  .

- Image handling with the help of Pillow and Tkinter .

- Easy to use.
